# Background
**Background:** Craigslist is one of the largest advertisement websites for viewing and posting local advertisements, covering various categories, including housing, job postings, items for sale, services, and personals. The data for this project was scraped from the website [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org).

**What is it about:** This project focuses on buying used cars and addresses a common issue with buying secondhand cars: the lack of control over pricing.

**Why does it matter:** Access to the right information can help anyone make informed decisions and find good deals when buying a car.

**Research Questions:**
1. Identify the trends in the sales of cars over the years.
2. Investigate the correlation between car price and its specifications.
3. Predict the price of a used car based on its specifications.
